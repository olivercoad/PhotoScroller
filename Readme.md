This is a simple program for just scrolling through a bunch of pictures.

Why did I make this instead of just using something like FastStone (or Picasa Photo Viewer)?
 - I wanted to scroll through **multiple adjacent directories**
 - I wanted a simple project to try out using [Avalonia.FuncUI](https://github.com/fsprojects/Avalonia.FuncUI) to make a cross platform GUI application with F#.
